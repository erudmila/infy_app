        About Me
        <h4>I am Jaunel Deans, currently enrolled as a junior (11th grade) at Thomas A. Edison High School, aged 16. My academic interests center around Global History and Web Development, with a particular proficiency in HTML and JavaScript programming languages. My ambitious and driven nature propels me toward a future aspiration of becoming an Aeronautical Engineer, focusing on the design of aircraft and propulsion systems, and the analysis of aerodynamic characteristics of construction materials pertinent to atmospheric flight.

          At present, I am actively contributing to the InfyApp Challenge as a member of The Quartet team. In my designated role as a Researcher and Communications Officer, I am responsible for conducting thorough investigations to augment our collective understanding of the chosen topic. This includes the formulation and execution of research studies, meticulous data collection and analysis, collaboration with team members, and the dissemination of our findings within the group.

          Furthermore, my responsibilities extend to managing and enhancing the public image of our app and ideas. This multifaceted role involves the creation of compelling content, facilitation of internal communication, and the oversight of brand management. Despite the demanding nature of these tasks, the satisfaction derived from contributing to the seamless functioning of our team makes it all worthwhile.</h4>
